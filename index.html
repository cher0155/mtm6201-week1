        Hi everyone! I'm Jeffrey Chery. You can call me Jeff  if you like. I was born and raised in Ottawa my whole life. I'm Haitian & Candian. I speak English & French. Throughout my whole life, I've went to french schools for my education. I'm currently at Algonquin College for the 2 year program IMD. I like to socialize a lot and be present with everything. I love to go out anywhere that's nature or many places in the city and have fun. I really love and appreciate arts such as music, photography, films, and espeically fashion. Fashion is something that I'm really passionate about and I consider it an external part of myself because I personally think it's a fun tool that I use to express and present my personality and my character in a very exciting and creative way.
